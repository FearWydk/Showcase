This is my Portfolio Repo. This allows me to show off pieces of code that I've made from projects.
It is being made to have components that are modular across projects to keep the size of the project low.
With an emphasis on clean and efficient code it was only right that it was also shown in my portfolio.

Project Pieces in Showcase:

Currently:
Boundary System[WORK IN PROGRESS]
Health System[WORK IN PROGRESS]
Save System[WORK IN PROGRESS]
Blueprint Function Library[COMPLETED]
